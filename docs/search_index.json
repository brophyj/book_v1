"],["simple-acknowledgment-and-request.html", "Simple acknowledgment and request", " Simple acknowledgment and request In writing this book, I was amazed at how much of this material I either never learned at all or didn’t assimilate completely on my first, and occasionally second and third, efforts. Consequently, I’m sure there are imprecisions, clarifications and outright errors that will need addressing. For reason that I outline in Section 1.5, I am releasing the first six chapters as “volume 1.” Hopefully, other chapters will be forthcoming in a timely manner. I would welcome all comments that may bring undoubted much needed clarifications, corrections, and improvements, including optimization of my R code. These may be addressed to me either by email or via Github. I should mention that any messages that begin “You ass@@@@ ….” will probably be ignored. "]]
